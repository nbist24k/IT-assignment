    <center><h1><i>What is Web Design?</i></h1></center>
   <h2><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="display: inline-block; text-align:left;">
    Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually <br> 
    refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software <br>
    development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop <br>
    browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has <br>
    become ever-increasingly important.
